                Asbestos was used extensively as a building material in Britain in the 20th century. Although some of this material has been removed over the years, asbestos is not just a problem of the past. It can be present today in any building built or refurbished before the year 2000.
<br><br>
When materials that contain asbestos are disturbed or damaged, fibres are released into the air. When these fibres are inhaled they can cause serious diseases.
<br><br>
When asbestos is found, our contractors at North London Demolition Groundwork work to ensure that the problem is dealt with swiftly and effectively to prevent exposure to the workforce and the public.
<br><br>
Our experienced team at North London Demolition Groundwork removes hazardous asbestos materials safely and in an environmentally sound way. When handling hazardous materials such as asbestos, Health and Safety is paramount to our team and that is why we ensure a fully compliant and safe environment for you to dispose of these materials.
